# Hackathon Problem Statement 1 (DIC)
## AI-Powered Dual-Layer MSME Growth Advisory & Subsidy Optimization Platform

### 1. Background and Context
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a critical role in economic development through revenue generation, employment creation, and sectoral growth. Various support schemes exist to strengthen MSMEs through financial assistance, technology support, and employment incentives.

However, several structural challenges persist:
* MSMEs lack clarity on which schemes best suit their business profile.
* Scheme selection is not always impact-driven.
* Budget constraints require intelligent prioritization.
* Projected economic impact (revenue and employment) is rarely simulated before allocation.
* Allocation decisions may lack structured justification and transparency.

There is a need for a software-based, data-driven system that enables predictive analysis, impact simulation, and optimized allocation under constraints.

### 2. Main Objective
The objective of this challenge is to design and develop a software-based, AI-driven dual-layer decision-support platform that:
* Provides MSMEs with personalized scheme advisory and projected economic impact analysis.
* Enables authorities to optimize subsidy allocation under limited budget constraints.
* Simulates projected revenue growth and employment generation.
* Supports dynamic policy prioritization between revenue and employment objectives.
* Ensures transparency by clearly presenting selection and non-selection reasoning.

The solution must be entirely software-based and must use synthetic datasets generated by participating teams following the mandatory schema.

### 3. System Architecture Requirements
The solution must include two integrated layers:

#### Layer 1: MSME Advisory Interface
This module must:
* Accept MSME profile inputs based on the mandatory dataset schema.
* Implement a machine learning model to predict **Growth_Category**.
* Generate a **Growth Score** on a 0-100 scale.
* Identify multiple eligible schemes.
* Simulate projected:
    * Revenue increase
    * Employment increase
* Recommend the most impactful scheme.
* Display before-and-after projections.
* Provide explainability for predictions and recommendations.

#### Layer 2: Policy Optimization Dashboard
This module must:
* Aggregate all MSME entries.
* Accept a total budget constraint.
* Provide adjustable sliders for:
    * Revenue Priority Weight
    * Employment Priority Weight
* Compute weighted impact scores.
* Select optimal MSME-scheme combinations such that: $$\text{Total Subsidy Allocated} \le \text{Budget}$$
* Display:
    * Selected MSMEs
    * Non-selected MSMEs with justification
    * Sector-wise allocation distribution
    * Total projected revenue gain
    * Total projected employment generation
* Support dynamic scenario simulation when policy weights are adjusted.

### 4. Mandatory Dataset Structure (Schema Only)
Participants must generate synthetic datasets (Minimum 300 entries for MSMEs, 5 for Schemes) following this structure:

#### MSME Dataset
* **Basic Information:** `MSME_ID`, `Sector`, `Years_of_Operation`, `Ownership_Type`, `Category`, `Location_Type`
* **Financial Indicators:** `Annual_Revenue`, `Revenue_Growth_Rate`, `Profit_Margin`, `Debt_Outstanding`, `Loan_to_Revenue_Ratio`
* **Operational Indicators:** `Number_of_Employees`, `Capacity_Utilization`, `Export Percentage`, `Technology_Level`
* **Compliance Indicators:** `GST_Compliance_Score` (0-100), `Inspection_Score` (0-100), `Documentation_Readiness_Score` (0-100)
* **Target Variable:** `Growth_Category` (High / Moderate / Low)

#### Scheme Dataset
* `Scheme_ID`, `Scheme_Name`, `Eligible_Sectors`, `Max_Subsidy_Amount`, `Target_Category`, `Location_Criteria`
* **Impact Factors:** 
    * `Impact_Factor_Revenue` (5-25%)
    * `Impact_Factor_Employment` (1-10 jobs)

### 5. Phase-Wise Evaluation and Checkpoints (Total Marks: 100)
| Phase | Focus Area | Marks | Key Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | Data Design & Assumptions | 15 | Mandatory schema implementation, logical generation, realistic ranges, balanced distribution. |
| **Phase 2** | Growth Prediction Model | 20 | ML model implementation, Growth_Category prediction, Growth Score calculation, evaluation metrics. |
| **Phase 3** | Scheme Eligibility & Impact | 20 | Multi-scheme eligibility logic, impact simulation (revenue/employment), before/after projections. |
| **Phase 4** | Optimization Engine | 25 | Weighted scoring, adjustable policy sliders, budget constraint enforcement, ranking/selection. |
| **Phase 5** | Dashboard & Integration | 20 | Functional interface, real-time simulation, transparency (reasons), visual summaries. |

### 6. Constraints
* Software-only solution.
* Synthetic data allowed.
* Single-year impact projection.
* Maximum 5 schemes.
* Each MSME may receive only one scheme.
* Budget constraint must be strictly enforced.

### 7. Expected Outcome
The final solution should demonstrate predictive growth modelling, multi-scheme impact simulation, budget-based optimization, revenue-employment trade-off analysis, and transparent and explainable decision-making.
