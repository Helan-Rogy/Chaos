Hackathon Problem Statement-1 (DIC)

AI-Powered Dual-Layer MSME Growth Advisory & Subsidy Optimization Platform

1. Background and Context

Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a critical role in economic development through revenue generation, employment creation, and sectoral growth. Various support schemes exist to strengthen MSMEs through financial assistance, technology support, and employment incentives.

However, several structural challenges persist:

MSMEs lack clarity on which schemes best suit their business profile.

Scheme selection is not always impact-driven.

Budget constraints require intelligent prioritization.

Projected economic impact (revenue and employment) is rarely simulated before allocation.

Allocation decisions may lack structured justification and transparency.

There is a need for a software-based, data-driven system that enables predictive analysis, impact simulation, and optimized allocation under constraints.

2. Main Objective

The objective of this challenge is to design and develop a software-based, AI-driven dual-layer decision-support platform that:

Provides MSMEs with personalized scheme advisory and projected economic impact analysis.

Enables authorities to optimize subsidy allocation under limited budget constraints.

Simulates projected revenue growth and employment generation.

Supports dynamic policy prioritization between revenue and employment objectives.

Ensures transparency by clearly presenting selection and non-selection reasoning.

The solution must be entirely software-based and must use synthetic datasets generated by participating teams following the mandatory schema.

3. System Architecture Requirements

The solution must include two integrated layers:

Layer 1: MSME Advisory Interface

This module must:

Accept MSME profile inputs based on the mandatory dataset schema.

Implement a machine learning model to predict Growth_Category.

Generate a Growth Score on a 0-100 scale.

Identify multiple eligible schemes.

Simulate projected:

Revenue increase

Employment increase

Recommend the most impactful scheme.

Display before-and-after projections.

Provide explainability for predictions and recommendations.

Layer 2: Policy Optimization Dashboard

This module must:

Aggregate all MSME entries.

Accept a total budget constraint.

Provide adjustable sliders for:

Revenue Priority Weight

Employment Priority Weight

Compute weighted impact scores.

Select optimal MSME-scheme combinations such that: $\text{Total Subsidy Allocated} \le \text{Budget}$

Display:

Selected MSMEs

Non-selected MSMEs with justification

Sector-wise allocation distribution

Total projected revenue gain

Total projected employment generation

Support dynamic scenario simulation when policy weights are adjusted.
